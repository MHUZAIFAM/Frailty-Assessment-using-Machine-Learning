## Seated Forward Bend Stretch (Flexibility)

### Age-Specific Averages and Flexibility Labels
| Age (years) | Male (cm) | Female (cm) | Flexibility Labels                    |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| 60-64       | 37.9      | 41.68       | > Average: Good Flexibility <br> < Average: Reduced Flexibility |
| 65-69       | 37.68     | 40.67       | > Average: Good Flexibility <br> < Average: Reduced Flexibility |
| 70-74       | 36.03     | 39.77       | > Average: Good Flexibility <br> < Average: Reduced Flexibility |
| 75-79       | 34.81     | 37.93       | > Average: Good Flexibility <br> < Average: Reduced Flexibility |

### Best Reading
- **Best Reading**: Maximum reading recorded during the test.

### Advice
- If flexibility is reduced, consider flexibility improvement exercises.

## Functional Reach Test (Balance)

### Balance Assessment and Risk Levels
| Measured Distance (cm) | Risk Level         |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| >30                    | Pass              |
| 25-30                  | Pass              |
| 20-25                  | Moderate Risk     |
| <20                    | High Risk         |
| <18.5                  | High Risk         |
| <15                    | High Risk         |

### Guidelines
- **Pass**: Measured distance is greater than 30 cm or between 25-30 cm, indicating good balance.
- **Moderate Risk**: Measured distance is between 20-25 cm, suggesting the need for balance improvement exercises.
- **High Risk**: Measured distance is below 20 cm, indicating a significant risk of balance issues.
- **Recommendation**: Consider immediate intervention for balance and stability training if in the high-risk range.

### Age-Specific Averages and Strength Labels
| Age (years) | Male (kg) | Female (kg) | Strength Labels                    |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| 60-64       | 42.85     | 26.31       | > Average: Good Muscle Strength <br> < Average: Low Muscle Strength |
| 65-69       | 39.98     | 25.20       | > Average: Good Muscle Strength <br> < Average: Low Muscle Strength |
| 70-74       | 37.36     | 23.82       | > Average: Good Muscle Strength <br> < Average: Low Muscle Strength |
| 75-79       | 35.07     | 22.49       | > Average: Good Muscle Strength <br> < Average: Low Muscle Strength |

### Best Reading
- **Best Reading**: The highest strength recorded during the test.

### Advice
- If muscle strength is low, consider strength training exercises to improve hand grip.
